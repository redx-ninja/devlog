# Entry 001 - Untitled Document

Dear {{ name_of_recipient }},

It has been a long time since we've spoken. The adventures we had and things we've learned. Complacentcy was the eventual killer of my emotional state.

After having worked in the corporate life, on my own, in a big city, for 8 years; I am now 30, going bald, and have no idea who I am.
In the back of my mind, I have this lingering feeling that I forgot how to feel emotionally. When I evaluate what I want in life to what I thought
8 years ago, I find that I don't even have the same goals.
It's as if I left home, disconnected from everything I knew, to go learn what was out there. 

My adventure started when I was a preteen around 2011 or so. Accessibility to internet just got better than connecting over the old
land line phone system. My programming adventure started as I would attempt to code my own versions of Neopets, Pimp Wars, and other
web based games that were out there. The language I learned was PHP and as a result I also ended up learning many things about how
the internet worked as I would battle hackers that would ruin the fun for other players.
This was the game that I played and that would teach me the skills I needed to land my first job for a small web hosting company that provided managed services.

Something I've always found facinating has been online chats. Back when I was around the age of 9 or 10, my parents would purchase their first computer
and connect to the internet through the telephone lines.

It was slow. The picture quality was crap. But they were obsessed with this chat software called "Yahoo!".
It wouldn't be long before I would pickup arms and make my own email accounts, chat accounts, and learn from just talking to people.
Before companies figured out how to collect our data and people were seemingly anonymous, online discussion was more interesting.
Talking about religion, science, politics, sex, and whatever was just commonplace before major internet policing occurred.
There's still Tor, but that's not a very homogonous cesspool to hang out in. It feels like the internet of yesteryear, littered with gross pedos.
Anyway, it used to be cool to have those chat rooms. I probably could've been kidnapped by some predator, some people really tried, but I
already had stockholme syndrome to stick with the family. 

So yeah, I used to enjoy just doing that. However now I have to be a few beers in to even tollerate people.
Working in IT has made me jaded. It seems like everything will happily keep moving without you if you don't stop moving. 
The quest for happiness and a social nexus has led me across the country and I've had a very great overall life experience so far. 

I somehow find myself unhappy and falling behind. I'm not clever. I'm not strong. I'm not ugly, but not attractive either. My mental state
is progressively more appathetic by the day. A while ago my car was hit at a low speed and my initial reaction was "meh", whereas just 5 years prior
I was extremely upset over someone that hit my car from behind.

In what started off as a coding adventure led to a quest to find myself and while I have no answer to who I am, I think I finally
know what I want to do next. I've been sitting here figuring out how to retire instead of living. 

COVID-19 is a problem now and life is on hold. I've been layed off as of June 2020, with only apathy to spare, probably because I already had a foot out the door.
Perhaps I'll find a new job soon. I have funds to hold me over till the end of the year.
I just don't want to enter another role where I think the product sucks or the service execution sucks or have all the training be purely "figure it out".
At my next job I want to solve a problem that I can measurably see the value. That is something I saw very clearly in my first job, but not my second.


## Game Dev Log
Right now I only know Linux and some DevOps stuff. Programming-wise, I've not been motivated to really complete anything since 2015.
For the past 3 years before COVID-19, I got really into Virtual Reality (VR). I've been periodically exploring content creation in VR and
it has been a mixed bag as I continue to learn. Prior I learned to make websites and winform applications. The only game development knowledge I
had was from modding an open source game called "Mirage Online". 

Being forced to learn how game development is done these days, to work with VR easily, I began to find that I really enjoyed working with
the tools. Unreal Engine opened my eyes and got me in the door of understanding how to do things with their blueprints scripting tutorials.
Eventually after a long 6 month break from working with Unreal Engine for VR, I would begin tinkering with Unity.

After making a few locomotion systems in Unity, I began to look into how player controllers would work in normal games.
The thinking for designing the player object hierarchy is worlds apart between traditional game development and VR game dev.

I have many ideas for VR that I need to put on hold. 

For normal player controllers I've found a click based system to move the player is quite intuitive if the right UI elements are introduced.

I'm starting to make single task scripts that can be mixed and matched for player movement. 

A need for a versatile event system is evident. Likely wrapping around `UnityEvent` will be worth-while. 

Camera angle is going to be tricky. I'm figuring out a way to do click based movement while platforming. So camera angles matter. 
Need to spec up in camera rigging. 

The end goal is to just prototype a toolkit that I can piece together to make levels. 

A question I will be pondering is what can I do for a good intro level?


It's been a while. How have you been?

Sincerely,
