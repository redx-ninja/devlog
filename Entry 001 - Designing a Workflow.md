# Entry 003 - Designing a Workflow

## Self-Evaluation
Everytime we grow mentally, it is because of circumstances that are caused by events in your life. These circumstances and events are
definitely what I've been dealing with as of late. However there is hope. The hope for being better than I was yesterday and yielding
better results is what I've strived for. It has reoccured to me that when we lose control of something, taking a step back to work
on what you can control is the most efficient way to better yourself and your situation. Guys like Buffet, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and so on;
when asked how they became successful, they all share the same thread of trying new ideas until something worked.

## Game Dev Log
My skills are coming along nicely. As of late, I have been learning how to do modeling, to tie back in with coding my game. Skills I
am focusing on are going to be in the following process for my pipeline, currently I'm focusing on phase 1. The long-term goal is to build 
a strong pipeline that will permit a single man to embark on very simple indie game development. Some people are able to just pound keys 
with an idea in their head and somehow transpose their thoughts into code. For myself, I need to know multiple workflows and what parts 
of it are there for what reason.

```
Phase 1. During this phase, the goal is to create the characters, world, and ideas. This can be done 1 level at a time. The output is
3D model asset files.

- World Building
- 3D Modeling
- Animation
- Focus either 1 biome or level at a time

Phase 2. In this phase, assets are imported and a level is assembled. Supporting code will be created, edited, and attached to objects
as neccessary to make the level work.

- Import assets
- Level design
- Coding / Orchestrating user input and game output
- Coding / GUI and Interaction system
- Coding / Only focus on big ideas, the things that the player uses to progress, these are player verbs

Phase 3. Simply test per level and reiterate through Phase 1 & 2.

- We are creating/revising/coding story now
- Cleaning up bugs

Phase 5. Once testing is done, the story is complete, a final polish is needed. Prioritize these in order, top to bottom.

- Lighting, focus on visual aesthetics
- Sound Design, cues and music
- Improve particle systems
- Shader work
- Play-testers, Streamers, Marketting?
```

This is my first attempt to iterate through the game development process. Going to test my theory out and continue to improve the phases as needed.
